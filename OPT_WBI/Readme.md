# OPT_WBI

This modlet has been provided as its own mod due to the complexity of WBI. The many adjustments expected to come may make it impractical to provide this as merely one among the static MM patches already provided within the OPT downloads.

This modlet will:

Remove dependency on Firespitter and Interstellar Fuel Switch (except for the required portion used by Night Mode made by Stali79 )
Support only Snacks LS. Do not install together with USI LS and my OPT_USI. You will get no support.

This modlet does:

Adds resource switching to all parts with few, OPT-specific templates to reduce clutter when picking modules.
Cockpits and cabins get fuel, KIS and snacks options.
Cockpits get AirPark feature.
Nose parts also get a SAS package.
Cargo and hollow bays get fuel, KIS and snacks options.
Remaining fuel tanks, inline SAS and wings get only fuel options.
Labs get Doc Science Lab features.
H cabin gets KIS and snacks options, and Geology lab, but no fuel.
H noses get fuel, snacks and SAS options.
Antenna gets WBI Geo scanner features.

This modlet does not:

Afford access to the full spectrum of WBI tankge options. If anyone asks (and I'm expecting it), I will gladly allow this but only for the cargo bays and hollow fuselages.
Support other life support mods.
