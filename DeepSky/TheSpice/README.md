# The Spice
The most precious substance in the universe has come to KSP. Texture work is currently barely on the to-do for this one. What mattes is that it's here and it works.

## Integrations
The following mods have these associations with The Spice:

### Absolute Dependencies
* Community Resource Pack : The Spice-related resources are currently cloned and renamed from CRP. Other actual CRP resources also required.
  
### Optional Dependencies
* USI Warp Drive : _Can't fold space without the core (plugin) from this._
* USI Life Support : _The Spice extends life... There's no 'life' to extend without a life support mod._
* TAC Life Support : _The Spice extends life... There's no 'life' to extend without a life support mod._

### Bonus Integrations
* Karbonite : _This mod contains harvesters for all forms of a resource, very convenient for this mod._
* Kopernicus : _Duna is not an appropriate host planet for the Spice. Once a certain supported planet pack is installed, that will change._
* JX2 Antenna : _Pending. The spice expands consciousness. By kerbal standards this must mean subspace/hyperspace level comms._
