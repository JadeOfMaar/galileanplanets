Things to do:

* Test animation trigger in spExt hub parts

* Install resource and texture switching for big balloon

* Fix attach nodes on boxes
* Repurpose or remove Japier-alike tanks
* Adjust categories, costs and TechRequired

* Find and install better plumes for Japier engines
* Change sounds for Japier engines
* Rig a stack engine or two (steal/integrate Karbonite rockets?), and VTOL engine(s)

* Add patches: exosphere harvester, resource scanner and antenna (prefer JX2 family)
* Dedicate a WormEssence drill

* Pick a planet from New Horizons
