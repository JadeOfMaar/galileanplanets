		// This experiment is biome-specific and only conducted while landed or splashed.
		
		CetiSrfLandedPoles = You scrape up some of the muddy material. It oddly seems like caramel and is deemed quite worthy of the storage space on the ship.
		CetiSrfLandedHighlands = The pale crust of this moon proves difficult to break a piece off of with your hands. You bet it will, however, easily surrender to your teeth.
		CetiSrfLandedMidlands = The soft, colored soil crumbles easily and finds a place in a a sample jar.
		CetiSrfLandedLowlands = You take up a fragment of the dark and oddly colored soil. You find find the blend of colors as gross up close as from any great distance, but you store it anyway.
		CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = It's pale, its gritty, it's easy to scoop up and therefore, has been. Easy science.

		CetiInSpaceHigh = Captain's log: We have entered naked-eye range of the moon. It's pinkish brown, and rippled...and looks partially digested. End log.
		CetiInSpaceHigh = Aside from the poor way the colors come together, the assortment of colors indivdually do make for a pleasant log.
		CetiInSpaceHigh = The rosy colors of Ceti's surface bring a momentary feeling of cheer to the crew. 
		CetiInSpaceLowPoles = The collective gaze is focused upon the dry caramel lakebeds that are the polar region. At least, we hope it's caramel.
		CetiInSpaceLowHighlands = The highlands becoming more inviting when viewed up close. The view of Gael is still pretty good from here.
		CetiInSpaceLowMidlands = As the terrain darkens and cycles colors, so too does your attention span.
		CetiInSpaceLowLowlands = You try with all of your might not to look directly at the most detailed parts of Ceti's surface.
		CetiInSpaceLowPlateaus = You consider it a trick of the eye that flat areas are present on a celestial body with this kind of condition, but alas, these findings make for plenty promise.
		CetiSrfLandedPoles = The landing gear is slow to spring back after touchdown. It's a good suggestion that this place indeed is not perfectly solid.
		CetiSrfLandedHighlands = We've landed on Ceti. Should we be proud? Should we have brought extra soap?
		CetiSrfLandedMidlands = Just looking at it from a few meters up, it isn't so bad. It's oddly familiar to cotton candy.
		CetiSrfLandedLowlands = Why is it this color??? Just... Why?!
		CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = A landing worthy of a a wide smile and a good few ribbons. You hope the Final Frontier system is recording this for whenyou return.

		// This experiment is mostly biome-specific. Any situation except FlyingHigh and FlyingLow may be used.
		
		CetiInSpaceHigh = In space... no one can hear you puke.
		CetiInSpaceHigh = Hey, it looks great up here! You exclaim, then you silently beg not to be sent any closer.
		CetiInSpaceLowPoles = You find it really hard to tell whether that brown stuff is good to eat or good to recycle.
		CetiInSpaceLowHighlands = Someone, somewhere, is cracking a stale Highlander joke... This time it's not you.
		CetiInSpaceLowMidlands = You mark the fact that the Midlands look pretty okay in whatever palatable aspect you find.
		CetiInSpaceLowLowlands = Fond memories, this view will not make.
		CetiInSpaceLowPlateaus = You find excitement in the presence of flat areas on this moon. And then everyone else follows suit when they read this, later.
		CetiSrfLandedPoles = Several emotions register as you set foot on the mud-like surface.
		CetiSrfLandedHighlands = It's rather bright out here when it's daytime...and rather bland when it's nighttime.
		CetiSrfLandedMidlands = Although this place looked like cotton candy from afar, remembering what everywhere else looks like bursts your bubble.
		CetiSrfLandedLowlands = Eww... That is all.
		CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = You make a note to bring next time some form of ski or sled equipment.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		// This experiment is mostly biome-specific. Any situation except FlyingHigh and FlyingLow may be used.
		
		CetiInSpaceHigh = The goo mimics the contours of Ceti's surface. Maybe it knows you don't like it.
		CetiInSpaceHigh = The goo writhes and shivers. It may be a farfetched idea but maybe the goo is also very unhappy to be here.
		CetiInSpaceLowPoles = The goo gives no discernable reaction. It must be straight-faced and with mixed opinions about the polar surface just as you are.
		CetiInSpaceLowHighlands = The goo hardens externally and holds well to the walls of its canister. It msut want not to float about in Ceti orbit.
		CetiInSpaceLowMidlands = You see wave motions in the goo's surface. You log this as one of the most random or cryptic responses ever observed from this kooky stuff.
		CetiInSpaceLowLowlands = The goo forms a protruding arrow head shape and points at Gael. it's clearly basically saying "Nope! Take me home please."
		CetiInSpaceLowPlateaus = You observe one wave-like motion on the goo's surface, as though a pebble splashed down. The goo must be in some sort of contented state.
		CetiSrfLandedPoles = The goo idles momentarily, then what appears to be an air bubble rises slowly, distending its surface until popping away. Any mature mind would consider this a gross action. The goo has spoken its smind.
		CetiSrfLandedHighlands = The goo once again mimics the ground detail. It's an amusing sight as this biome is a palatable one.
		CetiSrfLandedMidlands = The goo once again mimics the ground detail. You admire its amazing grasp on details. 
		CetiSrfLandedLowlands = The goo once again forms a protruding arrow pointing at Gael. You figure the goo to be quite childish.
		CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = The goo animates as though it was tank treads. It must want to ride around up here.

	@RESULTS

		// This experiment is mostly biome-specific. Any situation except FlyingHigh and FlyingLow may be used.
		
		CetiInSpaceHigh = The fluous materials swirl around as though provoked by an unexplained angular force.
		CetiInSpaceHigh = A ferromagnetic material polarizes. The ship's computer determines that Ceti posesses a notable magnetic field, unlike Iota.
		CetiInSpaceLowPoles = The ferromagnetic material shifts slightly yet notably. Ceti's magnetic field must have interesting proportions.
		CetiInSpaceLowHighlands = What... Why does this material look like the surface? Where on Gael--?!
		CetiInSpaceLowMidlands = Some of the materials appear to have oxidized or otherwise aged. You make a note to harass the Chemists back home, later.
		CetiInSpaceLowLowlands = Some of the materials change color. They begin to look somewhat unpalatable just like Ceti.
		CetiInSpaceLowPlateaus = No interesting response is found by eye or by the computer. This is arguably one of the strangest results yet.
		CetiSrfLandedPoles = A liquid material polarizes in the direction of Ceti's core. You wonder whether this same material will do this at every other world.
		CetiSrfLandedHighlands = A liquid mateial takes on some of the color of the surface. Fascinating.
		CetiSrfLandedMidlands = The materials jitter slightly and briefly.
		CetiSrfLandedLowlands = The computer scren makes a repulsed face smiley at you. Even the computer finds this place gross.
		CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = Once again the materials produce no interesting results. If they were sentient like the goo apparently is, you'd think they're quite content to be in this biome.

		// Biome-specific is not needed while InSpace but is very welcome when SrfLanded and SrfSplashed.
		// There's no point to InSpaceHigh results here.
		
		CetiInSpaceLow = The thermometer's reading is nothing special. If it's any warmer here than in high orbit then only the computer would notice.
		CetiInSpaceLow = The thermometer spikes! Oh crap! Oh wait... That heat is from the engines.
		CetiSrfLandedPoles = The temperature seems low here, but its rate of variance seems high. You wonder if the caramel-like surface has some intriguing thermal properties.
		CetiSrfLandedHighlands = Just a second after you gaze at the device, its value nudges by a miniscule factor. You wonder whether it's perfect timing with Ceti's albedo or somehow its receiving heat from somewhere else.
		CetiSrfLandedMidlands = The device does not respond. That makes it easy to grab a notepad and scribble down the number.
		CetiSrfLandedLowlands = The OSD (or thermal fluid's) color changes to green. The machines are speaking their mind.
		CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = The temperature value seems highest out of all the biomes so far. There must be an interesting material in this region.
