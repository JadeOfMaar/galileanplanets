		GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = You manage to catch an organism with your water sample. You throw it back because sciencing it is for another team of scientists.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = You find that the water carries a strong odor and is not fit for drinking. You wonder how the things that live in it, live.

		GaussInSpaceHighLowerRoseBand = You witness a glitch in the display. But it does not detract from the task at hand.
		GaussInSpaceLowUpperDarkBand = The temperature unexpectedly and inexplicably creeps up, like a housefly on an exposed meal.
		GaussInSpaceLowEquatorialTealBand = Temperature remains nominal, i.e., nothing.
		GaussInSpaceLowLowerRoseBand = The instrument glitches harder. You make a note to get it repaired, and maybe not trust it again for the rest of the mission.
		GaussFlyingHigh = The instrument begins to show modestly high numbers. You wonder how it can be this warm in a 'gas' planet and at this distance from Ciro.
		GaussFlyingHigh = The instrument glitches regularly and gives varying numbers. Maybe it's getting a fever and measuring itself too.
		GaussFlyingLow = The temperature is pretty high here... Too bad you're not.
		GaussFlyingLow = The instrument throws sparks and shuts off. It can't be by heat or everything else would be melting with it.

		GaelFlyingHigh = The barometer has little to say, just like there is little atmosphere to say anything about.
		GaelFlyingLow = The air is really thin but still useful for many conventional things.
		GaelSrfLanded = Lots and lots of millibars.
		GaelSrfLandedValleys = Although far from it, the slightly even higher reading makes you think of soup.
		GaelSrfLandedVolcano = The atmosphere becomes tense. Then your intensity intensifies with it.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = The atmosphere is gauged slightly denser than over land. Sea air must have its own weight.

		GaussFlyingHighUpperDarkBand = The pressure reading is high but is the lowest that you've seen so far. Strangely the display is dark.
		GaussFlyingHighEquatorialTealBand = The atmospheric pressure seems highest near the equator. Crumpling and creaking sounds suggest it might be a bad idea to descend further.
		GaussFlyingHighLowerRoseBand = The instrument produces a moderate reading. It's still darn high, though!
		GaussFlyingLowUpperDarkBand = The numbers climb very steadily and very far but the screen eventually implodes.
		GaussFlyingLowEquatorialTealBand = It's a wonder that the instrument can still operate at this level. The numbers grant you science as beautiful as the planet.
		GaussFlyingLowLowerRoseBand = The climbing numbers turn very quickly from bluish to rosy. Who programmed the device to match atmosphere colors?

		GaelInSpaceHigh = At this point you discover the ability to isolate the gravioli from Gael, her moons and Ciro.
		GaelInSpaceLow = There is not as much gravioli up here but still enough to detract a lot from TWR.
		GaelInSpaceLow = The instrument displays a butterfly symbol on-screen.
		GaelSrfLanded = The instrument displays a cat symbol on-screen.
		GaelSrfLanded = The readings climb somewhat and are skewed outward in a particular direction. You look in that direction and find Iota!
		GaelSrfLanded = The gravimeter shows the expected value. It changes in the tiniest amounts with altitude.
		GaelSrfLanded = The gravioli is curiously thick. Maybe this area is full of Lead or MetallicOre.
		GaelSrfLandedVolcano = The gravioli just falls right in... Hopefully it doesn't somehow un-cork the volcano.
		GaelSrfSplashed = The instrument displays a fish symbol on-screen.
		GaelSrfSplashed = The instrument shorts out. You remember that it is quite invulnerable except when the charger port is left open.

		GaussInSpaceHigh = The scanner indicates that, though the least of the giants, this one has an incredible pull.
		GaussInSpaceHigh = The instrument detects an unusually sharp dip in Gauss' gravitational influence around this distance.
		GaussInSpaceLow = Gravity readings spike sharply at this point. You wonder if you're passing over some sort of super-storm.
		GaussInSpaceLow = The gravity is intense. You wonder whether this is a correct value or the planet is messing with you.

		GaelSrfLandedMountains = You get some entertaining readings and wave actions on the display. They indicate that you are on the edge of a tectonic plate.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = Seismic activity occurs in a rather relaxed or dowbeat pattern. It might be a sign of things to come.
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = The activity here is slightly higher than normal.
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = You find a steady medium of geologic activity. It's not much but it is fun to look at.
		GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = You find a steady medium of geologic activity. This explains a lot of things and is worth celebrating with a frosty beer.
		GaelSrfLanded = You catch a brief spike. It is enough to log and celebrate with a beer.
		GaelSrfLanded = The results are nothing special but that means Gael will not swing her hips here and destroy things.
		GaelSrfLandedVolcano = The volcano is quiet. You may go to space tomorrow.
		GaelSrfLandedVolcano = The instrument's bland gaze shatters your dream. There will be no outback steakhouse built here.
		GaelSrfSplashed = The seismometer fails. You wonder how many tools other than the Science Jr are dysfunctional.

		GaelFlyingHigh = As you near the edge of space, the computer completes the presence curve for another array of local gases. You say something about all those curves then someone at Mission Control overreacts.
		GaelFlyingHigh = You find the lack of Oxygen disturbing.
		GaelFlyingHigh = Concerning your earlier concern about absent element particles, you find them all way up here. Ooooooh.
		GaelFlyingLow = As you pass through the clouds the computer shows a staggering abundance of water. This mystifies you.
		GaelFlyingLow = If clouds are full of water and water stops combustion then how do the engines--
		GaelFlyingLow = You notice a distinct drop in the percentage of Oxygen and the pressure of the air as you ascend. It amazes you how soon it becomes difficult to breathe.
		GaelFlyingLow = You mark the great thickness of the atmosphere in front of you. Friction, drag, lift, heat, they give good numbers.
		GaelSrfLanded = The atmosphere is as gentle as it is thick. The only way you can burn now is by Ciro.
		GaelSrfLanded = There are lots of floaty element particles down here but certain ones are nearly absent. You wonder why.
		GaelSrfLanded = So much Nitrogen! But why does it not kill us???
		GaelSrfLandedVolcano = No noxious fumes here. Except maybe from your engines.

		GaussFlyingHighUpperDarkBand = The instrument shows an immense presence of Hydrogen and Helium. You ponder how to capture these without having them burn around, and quite likely, inside your vessel.
		GaussFlyingHighEquatorialTealBand = The instrument registers roughly equal amounts of a dozen or more Volatiles. This explains the wonderous color palette.
		GaussFlyingHighLowerRoseBand = The instrument displays a short list of the most abundant chemicals, namely Nitrogen and Methane. You know for sure that these do not exist in kranberry juice.
		GaussFlyingLowUpperDarkBand = Several elements other than Hydrogen and Helium, and a number of compounds become more abundant.
		GaussFlyingLowEquatorialTealBand = You find even more of everything in this atmosphere. Even Water starts to show up!
		GaussFlyingLowLowerRoseBand = Despite the juicy colors, this place becomes even more full of gases that should not go down the hatch.
