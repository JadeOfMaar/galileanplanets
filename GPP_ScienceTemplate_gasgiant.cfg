	// This is how you add SCIENCCCCE. Take a definition below and write a result for it. 
	// Line breaks within results are not allowed.
	// You can have multiple results for the same definition. They will be pulled at random by KSP.
	
	
	// Recommended that you use an advanced text editor such as Notepad++
	//   so you can maintain indentation and duplicate and reorder lines with only key combinations 
	//   and use 'Replace All' function only within highlighted selection. Good for when you want to make results 
	//   for more than one planet in the same cfg file.


	// Change 'Planet' to the name of the chosen planet. Adding a multi-word biome? Insert it without spaces.
	// Example = EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta
	// For biome-specific results, the definition (before the = sign) must end with a biome name
	//   otherwise it will apply anywhere around the planet.
	// You can have a result for 'PlanetInSpace' or 'PlanetInSpaceBiome' if the result applies 
	//   for both PlanetInSpaceHigh and PlanetInSpaceLow.
