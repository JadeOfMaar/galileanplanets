		GaelSrfLandedPoles = The ice is very thick and fluffy. You wonder if it would mix well with the frost in the fridge back at KSC.
		GaelSrfLandedPoles = You immediately feel a fair portion of the coldness in your hand as you scoop it. Your suit's integrity has been challenged.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = Chemical analysis revals plentiful traces of igneous elements. This particular mountain may have been among the oldest active volcanoes.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = The instrumentation determines nothing special in the rocks here. But you make a note to go hiking on your next vacation.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = There's not much topsoil up here. Apart from thin air, the weather must be pretty unforgiving to plant life.
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = You find traces of silica in this rock. You wonder what practical applications can come of it.
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = The soil up here is charred and devoid of essential materials. But no natural phenomena are likely to cause this here...
		GaelSrfLandedMidlands = The soil is thick and moist, and the grass is tall. This place maybe a borderline swamp. Good thing it's not raining.
		GaelSrfLandedLowlands = You find a great abundance of one or more elements that consitute construction materials. The administration may be pleased with this find.
		GaelSrfLandedLowlands = It's pretty muddy down here. The water retention capability of the soil intrigues you.
		GaelSrfLandedLowlands = 
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = The soil is firm and rich, and the grass inexplicably carries a modest, uniform height.
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = 
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = Roses are red, violets are blue. The grass is as green as you. Wait...
		GaelSrfLandedDeserts = You've spent the last few months handling cold, smooth things in artifically cooled places. The heat and grit of the sand is like a siren's song.

		GaelInSpaceHigh = 
		GaelInSpaceHighPoles = The consensus is that it's really lonely and really flo... Shiny, wavy lights!
		GaelInSpaceHigh = The altitude here is magnificent. You make a gesture and pretend to grab Gael into the cabin and admire how small she's become.
		GaelInSpaceLow = The consensus is that it's really lonely and really floaty up here...
		GaelInSpaceLow = Today's log ends with "We are now halfway to anywhere."
		GaelFlyingHigh = Clouds have always been a marvelous sight from down below. Now even moreso as you pass through them.
		GaelFlyingLow = The mild acceleration of the craft causes a slight nervousness, but it is nothing in the face of the centrifuge.
		GaelFlyingLow = Although you are surrounded by a few layers of Aluminium and glass you get the sensation that you are hovering over the surface below. It is exhilerating.
		GaelSrfLandedPoles = You monitor the surroundings for an extended period of time. You realize that Ciro avoids the horizon and that the time of day does not change.
		GaelSrfLandedPoles = You note that Santa Kerman's house is not in sight. Maybe this landing was way off.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = This landing was pretty scary. Let's not do this again...
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = You find that this is a particularly bumpy yet spacious place. It's not too worrying, but not too inviting either.
		GaelSrfLandedMidlands = 
		GaelSrfLandedLowlands = Any landing you can walk away from is a good one.
