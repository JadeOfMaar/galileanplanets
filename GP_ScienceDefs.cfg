		GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = The ice is very thick and fluffy. You wonder if it would mix well with the frost in the fridge back at KSC.
		GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = You immediately feel a fair portion of the coldness in your hand as you scoop it. Your suit's integrity has been challenged.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = Chemical analysis reveals plentiful traces of igneous elements. This particular mountain may have been among the oldest active volcanoes.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = The instrumentation determines nothing special in the rocks here. But you make a note to go hiking on your next vacation.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = There's not much topsoil up here. Apart from thin air, the weather must be pretty unforgiving to plant life.
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = You find traces of silica in this rock. You wonder what practical applications can come of it.
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = The soil up here is charred and devoid of essential materials. But no natural phenomena are likely to cause this here...
		GaelSrfLandedMidlands = The soil is thick and moist, and the grass is tall. This place maybe a borderline swamp. Good thing it's not raining.
        GaelSrfMidlands = You've spent the last few months handling cold, smooth things in artifically cooled places. The heat and grit of the sand is like a siren's song.

		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = The soil is firm and rich, and the grass inexplicably carries a modest, uniform height.
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = Roses are red, violets are blue. The grass is as green as you. Wait...
		GaelSrfLandedTundra = Frosty mud and dead grass... It personally displeases you but it will make for science.
		GaelSrfLandedTundra = You find a few small crystal growths apart from the snowflakes. It's pleasing in that they should be larger but were, therefore, stunted.
		GaelSrfLandedShores = The sand has many textures but is mostly wet. It holds your interest and makes you hold more of it. For science of course.
		GaelSrfLandedShores = There isn't always sand at the border of land and sea. Today you learn that. End log.
		GaelSrfLandedShores = You pick up something that seems non-living-- a mollusk or coral. It offers you its science.
		GaelSrfSplashedShores = You find something grass-like but it confounds you. Is this actually grass?
		GaelSrfSplashedShores = The water is particularly messy here, especially when it's shallow enough to walk in and hence you raise sand in it by treading.
		GaelSrfSplashedShores = You pick up something smooth and wriggly. It's not a particularly gross thing so you happily science it.
		GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = The sample contains sediments not found in other biomes. This fascinates you.
		GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = Compared to sea water, this sure seems thirst-quenching. But there are still things operating in it, other than you.
		GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = You manage to catch an organism with your water sample. You throw it back because sciencing it is for another team of scientists.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = You find that the water carries a strong odor and is not fit for drinking. You wonder how the things that live in it, live.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = You manage to catch an organism with your water sample. You throw it out with a frown, knowing you won't have the time or permission to mind pets.

		GaelInSpaceIceCaps = The consensus is that it's even more lonely and even mo... Shiny, wavy lights!
		GaelInSpaceTundra = You've seen many shades of blue and white from the surface, but now you see them from way up here!
		GaelInSpaceLow = The consensus is that it's really lonely and really floaty up here...
		GaelInSpaceLow = Today's log ends with "We are now halfway to anywhere."
		GaelFlyingHigh = Clouds have always been a marvelous sight from down below. Now even moreso as you pass through them.
		GaelFlyingHigh = You are tempted to pretend you are moving at this speed in a car.
		GaelFlyingHigh = You quietly ask yourself "Can it go faster?"
		GaelFlyingLow = The mild acceleration of the craft causes a slight nervousness, but it is nothing in the face of the centrifuge.
		GaelFlyingLow = Although you are surrounded by a few layers of Aluminium and glass you get the sensation that you are hovering over the surface below. It is exhilerating.
		GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = You monitor the surroundings for an extended period of time. You realize that Ciro avoids the horizon and that the time of day does not change.
		GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = You note that Santa Kerman's house is not in sight. Maybe this landing was way off.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = This landing was pretty scary. Let's not do this again...
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = You find that this is a particularly bumpy yet spacious place. It's not too worrying, but not too inviting either.
		GaelSrfLandedMidlands = Midlands... nothing at first glance is found noteworthy.
		GaelSrfLandedValleys = Any landing you can walk away from is a good one. Here, though, is going to be a very tedious walk.
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = Now seems like a great time for a photo shoot.
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = You find that landing here rather than on a runway is much easier. You wonder why that is.
		GaelSrfLandedTundra = The landing seems wet due to interaction with snow and mud.
		GaelSrfLandedShores = You find that landing here rather than on a runway is much easier. You wonder what is up with that.
		GaelSrfSplashedShores = It's quite pleasing to see the geology and its radiant colors through the tint of the shallow water.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = The water's surface makes it hard to see down into it, but everyone agrees there's more than meets the eye.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = You take a brief dive down several meters and your sight is graced by flowery things and wriggly things passing by.
		GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = You've seen living things elsewhere in water. But their absence here is very curious.

		GaelInSpaceHigh = It's even more fun to fly around in EVA but it's amazing to see Iota and Ceti in their true colors... Whenever Ceti is visible anyway.
		GaelInSpaceHigh = You attempt to locate Ceti but he lurks, peeking from behind Gael like a shy or naughty toddler clinging to their mom's skirt.
		GaelInSpaceLow = You wish you had binoculars. It would be cool to try to spot the KSC with them.
		GaelInSpaceLow = Now is a great time to play with your jetpack thrusters. Do it!
		GaelFlyingHigh = Are you mad, bro?
		GaelFlyingHigh = You explode with Adrenaline, just like your ship explodes with Surface.
		GaelFlyingLow = So much fluffy white stuff. Can't see.
		GaelFlyingLow = Forget sitting tight. Feeling the adrenaline flow through you like the LFO mix while you hang for dear life is the greatest thing ever!
		GaelFlyingLow = You recall a chance look into a poster for something that would help out or would just be cool to have on you if you let go. You then recall the brand "Wild Blue..."
		GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = It's cold and mushy out here. Let's make snow angels and a snow-kerbal.
		GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = Your apetite for this climate is particularly low. You fill your report with both objective analysis and personal displeasure.
        GaelSrfLandedMountains = You declare yourself King Of The Hill.
        GaelSrfLandedMountains = "Mount [your first name]" coms to mind. It actually sounds good.

		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = You utter things in a Scottish accent, then you log them, then it's not as awesome anymore.
		GaelSrfLandedMidlands = This place is prtty nice. We should bring some wheels and rove!
		GaelSrfLandedMidlands = "Did anyone pack bacon or eggs?" You ask as you get this brilliant idea for an experiment.
		GaelSrfLandedValleys = You are below the ground...but you are not.
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = "Grass, everywhere. Skies, sunny." You say it in Perry W Kerman's condescending tone because that is a fact and it somehow utterly bores you.
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = This would be a grand place to build something big to land at... No, not another space center.
		GaelSrfLandedTundra = It's mushy and cold and frosty but not as awesome as the Ice Caps or the back of your fridge. A feeling of disappointment overcomes you.
		GaelSrfLandedShores = This portion of terrain is really nice. You wonder if Mission Control will let you strip down and take a five.
		GaelSrfLandedShores = You determine that it may be somewhat hazardous to tread here in a spacesuit.

		GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = The goo forms into a teardrop shape, dark blue and frosty, and leans, pointing i nthe direction of the magnetic pole.
		GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = The goo takes on the form ofa pair of candy canes. You wonder if it's safe to eat them. Then the goo quickly returns to its original form.
        GaelSrfLandedMountains = The goo clusters against the back of its canister.
        GaelSrfLandedMountains = Upon opening the canister you find a particualr sheen and a crystalline texture to the goo.

		GaelSrfLandedMidlands = The goo is particularly idle. Maybe it sleeps.
		GaelSrfLandedValleys = Somehow the goo is quite aware of the geology and forms into a sphere with the shape of this valley cut out from it.
		GaelSrfLandedValleys = The goo forms into an arrow pointing up or down. Does it like the idea of being below sea level? Or does it want to launch up?
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = The goo is quite mellow here. It sunbathes and starts to sparkle.
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = You catch the goo trying to slither down the side of the ship and escape. You make a special note about its chameleon trait.
