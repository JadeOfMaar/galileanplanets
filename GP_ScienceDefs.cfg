		GaelSrfLandedPoles = The ice is very thick and fluffy. You wonder if it would mix well with the frost in the fridge back at KSC.
		GaelSrfLandedPoles = You immediately feel a fair portion of the coldness in your hand as you scoop it. Your suit's integrity has been challenged.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = Chemical analysis revals plentiful traces of igneous elements. This particular mountain may have been among the oldest active volcanoes.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = The instrumentation determines nothing special in the rocks here. But you make a note to go hiking on your next vacation.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = There's not much topsoil up here. Apart from thin air, the weather must be pretty unforgiving to plant life.
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = You find traces of silica in this rock. You wonder what practical applications can come of it.
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = The soil up here is charred and devoid of essential materials. But no natural phenomena are likely to cause this here...
		GaelSrfLandedMidlands = The soil is thick and moist, and the grass is tall. This place maybe a borderline swamp. Good thing it's not raining.
		GaelSrfLandedLowlands = You find a great abundance of one or more elements that consitute construction materials. The administration may be pleased with this find.
		GaelSrfLandedLowlands = It's pretty muddy down here. The water retention capability of the soil intrigues you.
		GaelSrfLandedLowlands = 
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = The soil is firm and rich, and the grass inexplicably carries a modest, uniform height.
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = Roses are red, violets are blue. The grass is as green as you. Wait...
		GaelSrfLandedDeserts = You've spent the last few months handling cold, smooth things in artifically cooled places. The heat and grit of the sand is like a siren's song.
		GaelSrfLandedDeserts = The first desrt you visited had sand but this desert is an abyss of scorched rock. You woefully return to the ship to find something expendable with which to chip this rock.
		GaelSrfLandedTundra = Frosty mud and dead grass... It personally displeases you but it will make for science.
		GaelSrfLandedShores = The sand has many textures but is mostly wet. It holds your interest and makes you hold more of it. For science of course.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = You find that the water carries a strong odor and is not fit for drinking. You wonder how the things that live in it, live.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = You manage to catch an organism with your water sample. You throw it out with a frown, knowing you won't have the time or permission to mind pets.

	{
		GaelInSpaceHigh = The extreme weghtlessness makes the crew ponder things they normally wouldn't...like how long it would take to have snacks delivered to this height.
		GaelInSpaceHigh = The altitude here is magnificent. You make a gesture and pretend to grab Gael into the cabin and admire how small she's become.
		GaelInSpaceLowPoles = The consensus is that it's even more lonely and even mo... Shiny, wavy lights!
		GaelInSpaceLow = The consensus is that it's really lonely and really floaty up here...
		GaelInSpaceLow = Today's log ends with "We are now halfway to anywhere."
		GaelFlyingHigh = Clouds have always been a marvelous sight from down below. Now even moreso as you pass through them.
		GaelFlyingLow = The mild acceleration of the craft causes a slight nervousness, but it is nothing in the face of the centrifuge.
		GaelFlyingLow = Although you are surrounded by a few layers of Aluminium and glass you get the sensation that you are hovering over the surface below. It is exhilerating.
		GaelSrfLandedPoles = You monitor the surroundings for an extended period of time. You realize that Ciro avoids the horizon and that the time of day does not change.
		GaelSrfLandedPoles = You note that Santa Kerman's house is not in sight. Maybe this landing was way off.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = This landing was pretty scary. Let's not do this again...
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = You find that this is a particularly bumpy yet spacious place. It's not too worrying, but not too inviting either.
		GaelSrfLandedMidlands = Midlands... nothing at first glance is found noteworthy.
		GaelSrfLandedLowlands = Any landing you can walk away from is a good one.
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = Now seems like a great time for a photo shoot.
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = You find that landing here rather than on a runway is much easier. You wonder why that is.
		GaelSrfLandedDeserts = The external thermometers gradually spike. This causes intrigue.
		GaelSrfLandedDeserts = It surprises you that this place gets as cold as anywhere else at night.
		GaelSrfLandedTundra = The landing seems wet due to interaction with snow and mud.
		GaelSrfLandedShores = You find that landing here rather than on a runway is much easier. You wonder what is up with that.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = The water's surface makes it hard to see down into it, but everyone agrees there's more than meets the eye.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = You take a brief dive down several meters and your sight is graced by flowery things and wriggly things passing by.

		GaelInSpaceHigh = 
		GaelInSpaceLow = You wish you had binoculars. It would be cool to try to spot the KSC with them.
		GaelInSpaceLow = Now is a great time to play with your jetpack thrusters. Do it!
		GaelFlyingHigh = Are you mad, bro?
		GaelFlyingLow = Forget sitting tight. Feeling the adrenaline flow through you like the LFO mix while you hang for dear life is the greatest thing ever!
		GaelSrfLandedPoles = It's cold and mushy out here. Let's make snow angels and a snow-kerbal.
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = You get wild ideas and imagine that highlands are wrinkles on the face of Gael.
		GaelSrfLandedMidlands = 
		GaelSrfLandedLowlands = 
		GaelSrfLandedGrasslands = "Grass, everywhere. Skies, sunny." You say it in Perry W Kerman's condescending tone because that is a fact and it somehow utterly bores you.
		GaelSrfLandedDeserts = You find it quite hot out here. It is both a relief from artificial environments and a danger to your health.
		GaelSrfLandedDeserts = "Did anyone pack bacon or eggs?" You ask as you get this brilliant idea for an experiment.
		GaelSrfLandedTundra = It's mushy and cold and frosty but not as awesome as the Ice Caps or the back of your fridge. A feeling of disappointment overcomes you.
		GaelSrfLandedShores = This portion of terrain is really nice. You wonder if Mission Control will let you strip down and take a five.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = The water waves at you... Ba dum tiss.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = It's like being in space but really wet and tedious to turn and move.
