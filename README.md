# galileanplanets
My contribution to Galileo's Planet Pack (name bound to change), created by [Galileo](https://github.com/Galileo88) for [Kerbal Space Program](http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/). My contributions so far are:

* **Custom Science** Templates prepared but needs a lot of assistance. Not all of the celestial bodies will be covered but the most favored ones are still numerous.
* **Communinty Resource Pack configs** To enable the common mineable materials to be present on the new worlds.
* **Artwork**
* **Troubleshooting assistance**
