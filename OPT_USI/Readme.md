# OPT_USI

This modlet has been provided as its own mod due to the complexity of USI. The many adjustments expected to come may make it impractical to provide this as merely one among the static MM patches already provided within the OPT downloads.

This modlet will:

* Remove all prior fuel switch setups from the targeted parts.
* Add resources (and maybe USI modules) to all cockpits.
* Add resources and USI modules to all other crewed parts with exceptions.
  * The H cabins only get hab multiplier. There's no perceivable room to add anything bulky in there.
  * The H stack tanks and noses get the other things in order to compensate.
* The science labs currently get nothing. It's already settled that they're not allowed any tankage. As for modules I don't know what would be ideal. Suggestions welcome.
* Add resources to all cargo bays, service bays and hollow fuselages (J Deployment bays, Boarding Ramps, and Stail cargo bays not included).

The majority of parts' tank configs will not be touched.
