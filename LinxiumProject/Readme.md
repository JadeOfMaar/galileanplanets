# The Linxium Project
The Linxium family of radioactive alkali pseudometals is a tease for vanilla players, :P a fantasy-based intermediate propulsion platform between the stock nuclear engine and the Near Future mods, and an exclusive tidbit for Gameslinx's planet mods.

There are three variants of Linxium. Each has a special use case.
	
* Linxium11 is a very radioactive and toxic material with a very short half-life and can only be produced as a by-product of the ionization process in Linxium engines or immense thermal exposure inside a thermonuclear device. It is good for supplying extra EC for a short period of time during a burn or afterwards, and good for powering thermonuclear devices such as nuclear ramjet engines.

* Linxium12 is somewhat crystalline and the heaviest and most stable form of Linxium. It is good for retrieval for Funds, and currently nothing else. It is also incredibly rare in solid form but can be found in higher concentrations in the lava of some planets or moons.

* Linxium14 is slightly radioactive and degenerates very, very slowly. Its tanks are engineered to leverage this to provide EC like RTGs. This form is the best for fuel so you'll be mining this the most. You might very barely notice until you have multiple tanks on a ship. This can be good or bad depending on your perspective. It is fairly abundant in solid form and can also be found in liquid form in the lava of some planets or moons.

## Part List
This currently includes:

### Added  
* The I-LX series heavy lift ion engines.
* The J-LX series nuclear scramjet engine.
* GLX-Power nuclear reactors (built on the Convert-O-Trons).
* R-LX series RCS thrusters.

### Modified  
* The stock RTG, enhanced to consume byproduct Linxium11 from I-LX engine output and offset EC consumption.
* The stock Ore tanks.
* The Surface Scanner, Narrowband Scanner, and Orbital Survey Scanner.
* All intake parts, in order to consume IntakeAtm and feed J-LX engines on planets without Oxygen.
