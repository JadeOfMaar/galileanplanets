The Linxium family of alkali pseudometals is a tease for vanilla players, :P a fantasy-based intermediate propulsion platform between the stock nuclear engine and the Near Future mods, and an exclusive tidbit for Gameslinx's planet mod.

There are three variants of Linxium. Each has a special use case.
	
* Linxium11 is a very radioactive material with a very short half-life and can only be produced as a by-product of the ionization process in Linxium engines or immense thermal exposure inside a thermonuclear device. It is good for supplying extra EC for a short period of time during a burn or afterwards, and good for powering thermonuclear devices such as certain engines.

* Linxium12 is the heaviest and most stable form of Linxium. It is good for retrieval for Funds, and currently nothing else.

* Linxium14 is slightly radioactive and degenerates very, very slowly. Its tanks are engineered to leverage this to provide EC like RTGs. This form is the best for fuel so you'll be mining this the most. You might very barely notice until you have multiple tanks on a ship. This can be good or bad depending on your perspective.
